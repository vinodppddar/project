# SowEasy (Crop-Recommender)

Crop recommendation is a crucial aspect of precision farming. In agriculture, it is critical that the recommendations made are correct and precise, as errors can result in significant material and capital loss. The project uses Streamlit to create an app that helps farmers accomplish the following goals:

* the production of agriculture has increased
* decrease in the usage of chemicals in crop production
* maximizing the effectiveness of water resources
* preventing soil degradation in cultivated land

This Application recommends the best crop to plant based on Soil composition, Ph level, rainfall, humidity, and temperature. It was created based on a Kaggle dataset and can be accessed by the link below:
